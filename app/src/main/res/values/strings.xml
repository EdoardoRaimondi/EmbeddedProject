    Our app requires access to the GPS sensor as, in order to identify the places nearby you,
        it requires high accuracy in localization. In no case we will monitor your daily movements
        for commercial or espionage purposes. Our prerogative is to provide you a clear, efficient
        and transparent service; for this reason we would like to clarify that your position will be
        securely stored only on your device. We wish you a fruitful use and thank you for choosing us.
